- have alias in urls.py for api/ pointing to apiv1/urls.py
- can move api-auth/ to the apiv1 app?
- eline_one reports InterfaceIndex, l3vpn_one reports InterfaceId, is it the same?
- when adding 'ne' or 'service' to ServiceEndpointSerializer, then get error:
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Could not resolve URL for hyperlinked relationship using view name "ne-detail". You may have failed to include the related model in your API, or incorrectly configured the `lookup_field` attribute on this field.
